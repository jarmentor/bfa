# Statement of Influences

Reflecting on the diverse array of works and makers that have informed my work, I can broadly categorize their respective influences, at least in the main, as conceptual or aesthetic in nature. While these works and their effects on my work and practice are nuanced, I find myself strongly drawn to specific qualities of these works. Those particular aspects and the process that has yielded their existence have impacted not only my work but my process of making it.

My language of representation is highly gestural. My formal vocabulary of marks exists in a state of perpetual revision as I explore unfamiliar practices of making an image and refine familiar ones. The works of [Cy Twombly](https://www.artsy.net/artist/cy-twombly) are products of his experimental and exploratory development of a visual lexicon. Though primarily a painter, Twombly’s practice has also yielded sculptural propositions, photographs, and lithographs. The variety of materials and methods with which Twombly has worked doubtlessly informed his mark making repertoire. Remarking on Twombly and his artistic practice, Dominique de Menil stated,

> [He] is not an easy artist. He goes against the grain. He just scribbles, and things come into his mind—and he constantly is the opposite of a teacher who—bang, bang, bang—gives dates. But he evokes the past much better than a history teacher would—because to him it’s alive.

The visual language making up my work is heavily influenced by Twombly’s vocabulary of scribbles, textures, organic lines, and hand written textural elements. His emotive, energetic linear elements encourages a practice of diligent experimentation with my mark-making. The aspect of Twombly’s work I find most gripping is it’s content. His references of poetry and Greco-Roman history and the expression of that content in his characteristically emotive gesture imparts a richness to his unique style of abstraction that I hold in such high regard.

Similarly, the subject matter of artist and architect, [Maya Lin](https://www.artsy.net/artist/maya-lin), demands her research before a work can exist and communicate her ideas.  Her highly designed propositions exist as monuments, sculptures, or installations all of which she considers to be “earthworks.” While my aesthetic approach does not draw directly from Lin’s, her research-driven process prompted a reflection on and revision of my own process and contributed to the formulation of the visual metaphor in this body of work. Lin's works are effective because they confront societal issues of a global scope with characteristically minimal and poignant interventions. I consider Lin's perspective that of an informed maker—a data-driven creative making her mark through concept rather than gesture.

Contemporary architect and printmaker, [Frank Gehry](https://www.artsy.net/artist/frank-gehry), influenced my aesthetic leanings in these works. In a 2011 collaboration with Los Angeles-based workshop [Gemini G.E.L](https://geminigel.com), a building of his own design, Gehry created a series of two-color lithographs. In this series of six compositions, entitled *Puzzled #1–6*, I was drawn to his limited use of color, examining how such a formally interesting image could be achieved so simply. Gehry’s prints made me question the justification behind aesthetic choices in my own lithographs. I began to evaluate my work from a refreshed perspective, considering the reasons behind my aesthetic choices. Gehry’s lithographs communicate his ideas effectively using simple elements of organic line and shapes of fairly flat color. This relaxed line and simple shape allow room for viewer to interpret and ponder the image—an aim of my own in this body of work.

In looking at the work of [Jim Dine](https://www.artsy.net/artist/jim-dine), an unquestionably accomplished visual artist in an array of disciplines, my views were refreshed on composition and the importance of effective white-space in an image. In my experience an elegant and minimal aesthetic is difficult to maintain when addressing conceptual concerns and retaining recognizable subject-matter. In Dine’s series of one-color lithographs, *Brushes Drawn on Stone #1–5*, his exclusion of non-essential compositional elements yields in an abstract but sensitive representation that still effectively communicates its subject matter. Dine’s careful and purposeful construction of his composition is entirely antithetical to my own approach to image-making; however, his aesthetic choice of simplicity using line and shape is influential on my own methods of representational drawing.

Dine’s images reminded me that each layer of a print can, and arguably should, exist as an independent composition that engage its counterparts in the finished work. Dine’s drawings and single color lithographs have a meditative quality to them. There is a sense that their construction was just as meditative for the artist as the experience for the viewer.

 Terrence Malick’s 2011 film, *The Tree of Life*, served as a point of formal and conceptual departure in these works. Described as impressionist film, the experimental drama composed through the juxtaposition of fleeting moments as seen from the perspectives of various characters. The narrative component of the film, similar to the experiencing of a work of art, is a construction that exists in the mind of its viewer. My practice of composition is similar to this sequencing of ephemeral moments. When making an image, each intervention I make is informed by the one preceding it. Malick does not insist on a specific response on the part of the viewer, an idea in line with my experiential concerns in this body of work. In my view, the practice of abstraction deepens the engagement of the viewer; it allows room for interpretation and results in a more poignant personal encounter with the art object.

The component parts of my metaphor is sourced from [Brian McBride](http://www.kranky.net/artists/mcbrideb.html)'s *The Effective Disconnect*, an ambient musical proposition. Completed in 2010, the music was composed as a film score, *[The Vanishing of the Bees](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1521877/)*. For me, however, McBride’s experimental composition exists independently of its intended purpose of film augmentation. There is an undertone of contemplative sadness associated with both McBride's music and the music of his genre at large. Having listened to this release and compositions of similar artists for years, I find the work and its notes stay with me long after I remove my headphones. I frequently catch myself humming the distinctive and tragic melodies of McBride’s *[Toil Theme Part 3](https://open.spotify.com/track/3AMxgPtQUUNLnDfEwi4pff?si=PHg1FTJLQSeh0zDqMTtfsw)*. I aim for these works to achieve a similar response in the viewer—the communication of a similar tragic feeling while suggesting the viewer’s introspection and continued contemplation.
