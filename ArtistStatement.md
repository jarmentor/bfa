# Artist Statement

My work explores the dynamic relationship between humankind and the environment that both contains it and it manipulates. This process using human-designed machinery and chemical manipulations to produce an image lends itself to my documentary exploration of man and nature’s relationship central to the works. In making my work, I simultaneously play both roles, intervening in the composition and reacting to those interventions.

Humans bend and morph their surroundings to survive and thrive while nature responds and adapts to those manipulations. I inspect this eternal waltz of human intervention and environmental response through images highlighting a representative part of the more global relationship.

If the honey bee population continues to decline from the consequences of human intervention, the structure of the ecosystem, from herbivores to carnivores, will undergo a dramatic and irreversible shift.

## Additions

When I make an image, I take a deconstructive approach to subject matter. I compartmentalize meaningful elements and their associations and build a composition from the elements....... `lost it`

Most of my images dialogue with the counterintuitive relationship of man and his surrounding environment. Man at once occupies the states of tool maker and `something about being part of the environment he affects to his own ends.`

`diametric between mankind's tool-building nature and nature's reactionary approach to balance`

My images serve as a visual record of research.

I take a Gestalt approach to the construction of a composition. To me, a finished image is greater than the sum of its component parts. The act of composing the image imbues a new dimension to both the art object and its subject matter. 

`It is in this space that the content sits. ------------------ yawn` 

My images take the crux of issues with global scope and apply that concept to a much smaller, but still significant, relationship indicative of the whole. A successful image, then, would engage both perspectives.

Engaging the oppositional nature of the inhabitant and the habitat.

My images confront the viewer simultaneously creating an acute awareness of the macro and micro relationships between man and his affect on his environmet.

## Q+A....

### What is success in your work?

 - call attention to an easily overlooked element of a much larger whole while engaging both the micro and macro perspectives
 - engagement and education with the viewer — effecting an altered experience or perception extending outside the picture plane

### Why express ideas using imagery?

 - an image's inescapeable abstraction allows for interpretation by its viewer. Thus, the object engages on a personal level
 - a non-standard visual proposition demands the viewer's engagement and attention.
  -  an image invites interpretation and thus creativity within the viewer. The ability to facilitate that experience is..... `<something>`
