# Artist Statement

My work explores the dynamic relationship between humankind and the environment that both contains it and it manipulates. My images are made via stone lithography. This process using human-designed machinery and chemical manipulations to produce an image lends itself to my documentary exploration of man and natureâ€™s relationship central to the works. In making my work, I simultaneously play both roles, intervening in the composition and reacting to those interventions.

Humans bend and morph their surroundings to survive and thrive while nature responds and adapts to those manipulations. I inspect this eternal waltz of human intervention and environmental response through images highlighting a representative part of the more global relationship.

If the honey bee population continues to decline from the consequences of human intervention, the structure of the ecosystem, from herbivores to carnivores, will undergo a dramatic and irreversible shift.
